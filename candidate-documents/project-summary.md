# Evaluation Project Summary

Name: Ron Cox

Date: May 6, 2019

Candidates should answer the following questions. Additional documentation, 
process, or work artifacts should be contained in this `candidate-documents`
directory.

Please consider these questions: Most of them require more than a 
few words to answer, but you should not feel obliged to write a long essay.

## How long did it take you to complete this project?

I did not keep a timer, but I'd estimate between 10-12 hours of concentrated work time. This was my first
real introduction to Vue.js, so a great deal of that time was spent getting familiar with the way Vue
works and communicates with its various parts. I made a lot of mistakes, and chased a number of ideas
to their inevitable dead ends, but it was a great trial-and-error exercise, which I feel is the best
way to learn.


## How did the project go for you?

I enjoyed working on this project, and found most of the primary requirements straightforward and
useful. The biggest difficulty I had was with the unit tests, as I initially misunderstood how the
store was accessed. Overall, I really liked Vue!


## What are you especially proud of in this project?

Sorting by movie title without articles.


## If you could revise, refactor, or spend more time on any aspect of the project, which would it be?

I'd work on the stretch goals more. I eventually abandonded filtering by favorites, after my first
effort resulted in some markup that I wasn't happy with, and ultimately determining my solution was
not in the spirit of the assignment. I'd also like to spend more time on events and communication
between components.


## If you were making up the project for others to complete, what would you change, add, or remove?

I'd make the genre items look less like actionable buttons. I might also add some more exercises to
work with the Vuex store.


## Was this project fun?

It actually was!


## Feel free to include any other thoughts or feedback you have for us.

Thank you!
